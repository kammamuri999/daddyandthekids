In 2012, I became a father for the first time. It was exciting but I had no idea what to do with the baby. 

At this point in my life, I am married to my wife for over 10 years, we have 3 kids (2 girls, 1 boy of 2 - 6 and 9 yo now in 2021) and I am working night-time at home as a writer, web developer, and musician. And on day-time as a physician.

How can I concile being a family man, being a physician, and being an artist? 

Well, even if I struggle a lot with this, the secret is letting go perfectionism and adopting a growth mindset by trying to get better and better at everything, little by little, day by day. Learning from your errors and keeping on studiyng and improving.

I also sleep a lot less than I should... and that's my bad! 

I am not super efficient or hyper-productive. I am lazy, I procrastinate a lot, I want to be on vacations. I find it difficult to start doing something. But every now and then I win the inertia and reach flow state, and that's when the magic happens. In a week I can write 10 posts, and a few songs...

At this point, I am 41 years old. 

This blog is an attempt at documenting my new found joys and struggles as a dad of 3.
I'll try to share what is useful and I hope you can get some help on your way as a parent.
The main theme is learning to be a parent by doing. Through my blog I hope to give you good ideas, good advice, and insightful views of  the fathering experience.
