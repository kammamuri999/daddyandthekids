Hi!

I'm **Dominic**, father of 3 beatiful kids of 2, 6 and 9 years old. 

This blog is the result of my research, experience and everyday life as a dad.

I write down my thoughts as I learn the art and craft of being a dad along the way, trying to improve and to give my kids a healthy, safe and bright life.
